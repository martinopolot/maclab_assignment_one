# Assignment

- **I am currently a **Full Stack Web Developer student\*\* driven by a mission to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. My journey in tech is defined by several core objectives:

- **Learning from Scratch**: I am building a rock-solid foundation in software engineering, starting from the fundamentals to ensure no gaps in my technical knowledge.
- **Transforming Healthcare**: My ultimate goal is to build systems from the ground up that help **nursing institutions** leverage technology. I aim to digitise routine workflows, improving efficiency and patient care through custom-built software.
- **Deep Technical Understanding**: I am committed to mastering the internal mechanics of the full-stack ecosystem, specifically focusing on **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Database Management Systems (DBs)**.
- **Mentorship at MacLabs**: I have chosen to learn from the best at **MacLabs**, an institution I recognize as a leader in the industry, to ensure my skills meet world-class standards.
- **Systems Engineering**: Beyond just coding, I want to understand how to architect entire systems that are scalable, secure, and impactful.

## My Goal by week 30 at MacLabs

By the conclusion of Week 30, I aim to leverage my full-stack expertise to architect and deploy a **Regional Health Worker Verification System for East Africa.**

### The Vision

A unified digital platform designed to streamline the verification of **Nurses, Midwives, and Doctors** across East African borders. This system will:

- **Enable Professional Mobility**: Simplify the process for healthcare workers to move and practice across the region by providing instant, verifiable credentials.
- **Enhance Regulatory Trust**: Provide a "single source of truth" for hospitals and institutions to verify the licenses and qualifications of medical staff.
- **Leverage the Full Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: A responsive dashboard for regulatory bodies and health workers.
  - **Backend (Node.js)**: Secure APIs to handle verification requests and data processing.
  - **Database**: A robust, encrypted database to store professional records and certification history.

## My target audience

- Nurses
- Midwives
- Doctors
- Public
  - Employees
  - Researches

## Code screenshoot
